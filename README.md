Decision Tree 


## Visualizing Tree

A visualization of the decision can be generated by calling the `Graph(w io.Writer)` method
on the Tree.  This will output a `DOT` file of the graph which can be turned into a `PDF`
using the following command.

    dot -Tpdf decision.dot > decision.pdf 

Example
```
	writer, err := os.Create("decision.dot")
	if err != nil {
		c.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()
	tree.Graph(writer)
```
